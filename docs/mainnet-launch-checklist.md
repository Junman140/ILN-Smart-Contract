# Mainnet Launch Checklist

This checklist tracks the minimum readiness requirements before ILN mainnet deployment. Status values are maintained manually during planning and automatically refreshed for rows that link to GitHub issues when those issues are closed or reopened.

Status legend: `Not started`, `In progress`, `Blocked`, `Complete`.

## Automation

Rows that include GitHub issue links are updated by `.github/workflows/mainnet-checklist-sync.yml`:

- Closed linked issue: status becomes `Complete`.
- Reopened linked issue: status becomes `In progress`.
- Unlinked rows remain manually maintained.
